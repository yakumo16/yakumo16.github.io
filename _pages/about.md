I'm a doctoral student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests include multimodal behavior signal analysis, multimodal information fusion, intelligent speech processing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Juan Liu](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2890.htm) from [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University, and [Prof. Ming Li](https://sites.duke.edu/dkusmiip/2022/11/11/bio-of-prof-ming-li/) from [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/).
